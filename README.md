================

Semantic Stylus for pure CSS drop shadows.

This is essentially a re-write of [Nicolas Gallagher's](http://nicolasgallagher.com/css-drop-shadows-without-images/) CSS drop shadows, but in Stylus, so that they can be added to elements cleanly.

Provides mixins:
	sh-raised()
	sh-rotated()
	sh-lifted()
	sh-curved-vt-1()
	sh-curved-vt-2()
	sh-curved-hz-1()
	sh-curved-hz-2()
